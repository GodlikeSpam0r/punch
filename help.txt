$ punch
    Print current month. By default, today is highlighted in blue, the most recently
    updated day in pink.

$ punch HH:MM-HH:MM HH:MM-HH:MM ...
    Add blocks to today. Minutes are optional. The colon is optional when
    providing minutes.

    $ punch 08:00-12:00 12:30-18:00
    15.02.15   08:00-12:00   12:30-18:00   Total: 09:30

    Possible shorthand that does the same thing:

    $ punch 8-12 1230-18

$ punch HH:MM
    Adds or completes an existing ongoing block.

    $ punch 8
    15.02.15   08:00-        Total: 00:00

    $ punch 12
    15.02.15   08:00-12:00   Total: 04:00

$ punch now
    Start or complete a block with the current time. Can also be used inside
    of a full block punch.

    Example day starting at 08:35:

    $ punch now
    15.02.15   08:35-        Total: 00:00

    At 10:35:

    $ punch now
    15.02.15   08:35-10:35   Total: 02:00

    At 18:00:

    $ punch 11-now
    15.02.15   08:35-10:35   11:00-18:00   Total: 09:00

    Punch rounds the time to five minutes by default with a "fair" strategy.
    Meaning 08:32 gets rounded down to 08:30 and 08:33 up to 08:35. To change
    that strategy set the config.punch_now_rounder option to one of the
    following Symbols:

    * :fair, the default behaviour described above,
    * :greedy, rounds to your advantage ;),
    * :exact, don't round at all

$ punch [card] ...
    Load a card configuration before punching.

    Say you have a card called "workout" that sets up a different hours folder
    for you to save your workout time to:

    # in .punchrc
    config.cards = {
      :workout => {
        :hours_folder => "Users/radi/Dropbox/punch/workout"
        :title => "Workout"
      }
    }

    you can load that card and punch it with:

    $ punch workout 21-22

    Card names can be tab-completed when bash completion is installed.
